/*
Given two integers, A and B we are interested in position at which the decimal representation of 
A occurs as a SubString in thedecimal representation of B (counting from 0). For example:

-53 occurs in 1953786 at position 2 
                ^^
-78 occurs in 195378678 at position 4 and 7

Write a method solution(int A, int B) and returns 
the leftmost position at which A occurs in B.

This function should re turn -1 if A doest  not occurs in B .
Give A = 53 and B =1953786

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    static int find(int A, int B){
        String u = "" + A; // force convert
        String v = "" + B;
    return v.indexOf(u);
